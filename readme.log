This is just taking my javascript skills to made a website. In this site I have used JavaScript and CSS framework i.e Bootstrap.
since I have focus mainly on javascript part hence I have use the framework of CSS. I have used the layout idea from diffrent 
computer store that we have in our country, for example ryans, startech, techland. I have downloads the items directly from the 
official product website but not from the above mentioned sites. If you have any suggestions you can reach me out at stanleydr77@gmail.com
Thanks and stay safe. 
 Things I have added using JavaScript:
 J1. mouseout and mouseover over the dropdown menu (index page)
 J2. Image slider (index page)
 J3. Adding items using loops and innerHTML (index page)
 J4. Adding a blinking effect on the text "winter sale is here!"
